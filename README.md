### How to install

[TODO: tell user where he should get keys, where they should be and how they look like]

Python3 should be already installed. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before run script 

1) Get API Token key according bitly [documentation](https://dev.bitly.com/get_started.html)
1) Assign token value to environment variable `export BITLY_TOKEN=YOURSECRETTOKEN`
or create `.env` file in the root folder according [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/#usages) documentation
